1. What is your favourite new javascript feature and why?
=>The flatMap() method is identical to the ES6 map method, but also flattens at the same time. The flatMap() method first maps each element using a mapping function, then flattens the result into a new array. flatMap() is often quite useful, as merging both into one method is slightly more efficient.

2. Explain an interesting way in which you have used this javascript feature.

3. Is there any difference between regular function syntax and the shorter arrow function syntax? (Write the answer in your own words)

Regular Function:-

3. Arguments objects are available.
4. These are constructible(they can be called using the 'new' keyword) & callable.
Arrow Function:-
1. ()=>{}
2. Arrow functions don't have own definition .
3. Arguments objects are not available.
4. These are only callable not constructible.
